# 🚆 Railway Booking System

## 📌 Overview
The Railway Booking System is a web application built using Python (Flask) that allows users to register, log in, and manage bookings.  

This project demonstrates a complete **DevOps implementation**, including containerization, CI/CD automation, infrastructure provisioning, and Kubernetes testing.



## 🚀 DevOps Implementation

- CI/CD: Jenkins  
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose  
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (tested locally using Kind)  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform  
- Cloud: AWS (EC2)  
- Version Control: Git  



## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- User → Public IP → EC2 Instance → Docker Containers  

### Services:
- Flask Application (Backend)  
- MySQL Database  


## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Flow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. Jenkins pipeline is triggered  
3. Application is built and tested  
4. Docker image is created  
5. Application is deployed on EC2  
6. Application is accessed via public IP  



## 📦 Features

- User registration & login  
- Password reset functionality  
- Booking management  
- MySQL database integration  



## 🐳 Docker Setup

### Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t railway-project .


### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Application

[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)



## ☸️ Kubernetes (Testing with Kind)

* Tested the application in a local Kubernetes environment using Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)
* Created manifests for Deployment and Service
* Verified application inside the cluster



## ☁️ Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

Terraform is used to provision AWS infrastructure.

### Resources Created:
- EC2 Instance (Ubuntu)  
- Security Groups (Ports: 22, 80, 8080)  
- Basic networking setup  

### Automation using user_data:
- Installed Jenkins  
- Installed Docker & Docker Compose  
- Configured system for deployment  


## ⚙️ Jenkins CI/CD

- Jenkins installed on EC2 instance  
- Pipeline defined using `Jenkinsfile`  
- Automated build and deployment workflow  



## 🗄️ Database Setup

* MySQL is used as the database
* Tables are automatically created using `init.sql` during container startup

### Verify Data (Optional)

```bash
docker exec -it <mysql-container> mysql -u root -p
```

```sql
USE railway_system;
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## 🛠️ Challenges Faced

* Docker container communication issues → resolved using Docker Compose networking
* Terraform provisioning errors → fixed by correcting AMI and security group rules
* Jenkins permission issues → resolved by adding Jenkins to Docker group



## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add Application Load Balancer (ALB) for high availability
* Configure Route53 for domain-based access
* Implement auto-scaling
* Add monitoring using Prometheus & Grafana
* Deploy on managed Kubernetes (EKS)
